Usage
-----

rotjoin [-p <prefix>] -b <timestamp> -e <timestamp> [-o <filename>] [-f flac|wav] [-h]

Creates output audio file containing all audio between specified timestamps.
Source audio should be contained in minute-long files as <prefix>YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM.[flac|wav].
Output file will have same sample rate and no. of channels as first input file opened.

   -p <prefix>    Prefix where the minute-long ROT files are located (may contain / characters)
   -b <timestamp> Begin timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[.xx] format
   -e <timestamp> End timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[.xx] format
   -o <filename>  Output filename (stdout if not specified)
   -f flac|wav    Output format (FLAC or WAV). If not specified, format determined from output
                  filename if possible, otherwise from first input file opened.
   -h             Display this usage message and exit


Installation
------------

There is one required dependency:

* libsndfile
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
  
This must be present and installed before this program can be built.

The program can be compiled by issuing a simple "make" command. If
necessary, any include or library path required for libsndfile can be
added to the INCLUDES and/or LIBS entries in the Makefile.

To install the program issue the command
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
This will install to /usr/bin (the default value of PREFIX is /usr/local).


Overview
--------

This utility can be used to join a series of WAV or FLAC audio files
(or parts of files) into one larger file for seamless playback. The
input files to be joined should be stored in minute-long files in a
hierarchical directory structure with the naming convention

    <prefix>YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM.[flac|wav]

Where <prefix> can be specified on the command-line. Typically <prefix>
will end with a trailing / character, although this is not required.
Separate beginning and ending timestamps must be specified with the -b
and -e flags respectively, and all audio between the two times will
be output to the file specified with the -o option, or to standard
output if the -o option is not given.

If possible, the output file format will be determined automatically
from the filename extension (if this consists of either ".flac" or
".wav"). Otherwise (always in the case of output to standard output),
it will be set to the same file format as the first input file opened.
Both these behaviours can be overridden by specifying the -f flag with
an argument of either wav or flac. The output file format will then be
forced to this format, irrespective of the filename extension or the
format of the input files.

The output audio will have the same number of channels and sample rate
as the first input file opened. If subsequent input files do not have
the same number of channels and samplerate as the first, the output
may be distorted.

On succesful appending of each input file, the program will print a
line to standard error of the form:
File "input-filename.wav": x.xxxxs output
where x.xxxx is the duration of audio output in seconds, to four decimal
places.

When all input files have been processed and the output file closed, the
program will print a line to standard error of the form:
Total output duration: x.xxxxs
indicating the total duration of output audio, again in seconds to four
decimal places.
These lines are suitable for parsing by a script.
